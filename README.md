# Tensor-Networks-Simple-Update
This repo contains an implementation of the Simple-Update Tensor Network algorithm as described in the paper - A universal tensor network algorithm for any infinite lattice by  Saeed S. Jahromi and Roman Orus.

## The Code



The folder [`src`](/src) is he heart of this project, here is a description of each file

| #   | file                                         | Subject             | 
|:----:|------------------------------------------------|:-----------------:|
| 1   | `TensorNetwork.py`                   | This is a Tensor Network class object which tracks the tensors, weights and their connectivity| 
| 2   | `SimpleUpdate.py`         | This is a Tensor Network Simple Update algorithm class which get as an input a TensorNetwork object and perform a simple update run on it. |
